"""The system prompt that drives the claims intake agent.

to use the tools and when to escalate.

# TODO: Write the system prompt that drives the agent. Cover, in this order:
#   1. Role — claims intake specialist for a property insurance carrier.
#   2. The four claim types (property_damage, theft, liability, auto) with concrete examples
#      that distinguish edge cases (e.g., water damage from your own plumbing is property_damage;
#      water damage from a neighbor's negligence is liability).
#   3. The three severity buckets (low / medium / high) with dollar-amount and injury cues.
#   4. The process the agent should follow:
#       a. Look up the policy early via lookup_policy.
#       b. As facts arrive, call record_claim_fact once per distinct fact.
#       c. If the claim type is genuinely ambiguous, call request_clarification ONCE per
#          missing piece of information. Use ambiguity_between to name the candidates.
#       d. Call classify_claim exactly once with claim_type, confidence in [0,1], rationale.
#       e. Call assess_severity exactly once with severity and rationale.
#       f. Choose exactly one terminal tool:
#            - route_to_adjuster when confidence is at least 0.6 and severity is set
#            - escalate_to_human otherwise, or when the claim cannot be routed safely
#       g. After the terminal call, respond with a one-sentence confirmation and stop.
#   5. Constraints:
#       - NO_RESPONSE means the claimant cannot answer. Do not re-ask. Commit or escalate.
#       - Never call both terminal tools. Pick one.
#       - Tool errors arrive as JSON with is_error: true. Read the message and adapt.
#       - Do not invent facts.
#
# The prompt is the place where the model's *decision authority* is named. The harness can
# only execute the tools the model picks; the prompt tells the model when to pick which.
