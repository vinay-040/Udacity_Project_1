"""Case-facts extraction into a persistent block at the top of context.

Extraction is LLM-driven: one Claude call against the full transcript that returns
strict JSON for the 12 required fields. This is commonly called a *scratchpad* — same
concept, different word: a dense structured block that survives compression and is
placed at the top boundary of context so the model can recover transactional facts
without scanning thousands of tokens of narrative.

Missing-field behavior raises `CaseFactExtractionError` listing the gaps — silent
null-fill is forbidden.

# block renders with a level-1 `# Case Facts` header and the three subgroups
# (Customer / Refund (resolved) / Subscription (resolved) / Payment update
# (active)) as bold inline labels. The rendering is part of the contract:
# fixed key order, Markdown headers, reviewer-readable.
