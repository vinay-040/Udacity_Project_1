# /deploy-check

Runs the team's pre-deployment validation checklist against the current working tree and the branch you're about to ship. Read-only by design — this skill never modifies files, never pushes, never deploys. It returns a single structured summary so the calling session can decide whether to proceed.

## Why this is a skill (not a CLAUDE.md addition)

<!--
TODO: Write a 2-3 line decision rubric explaining why /deploy-check is a SKILL
      rather than always-loaded CLAUDE.md guidance.

      The contrast you must convey:
        - Skill: on-demand, forked, task-specific. You only need it right before a
          deploy. It produces verbose intermediate output (file enumeration, diff
          parsing, check execution traces) that has no value once the summary is
          known.
        - CLAUDE.md: always-loaded, universal. Conventions that need to be present
          in every session (e.g. "tests are co-located", "throw ApiError for
          validation failures") belong here.

      Without this contrast, teammates default to dumping everything into CLAUDE.md
      and end up with a 600-line monolith that wastes context on every session.

      Rule-of-thumb summary at the end: on-demand / forked / task-specific → skill;
      always-loaded / universal → CLAUDE.md.
-->

## Why `context: fork`

<!--
TODO: Write the rationale paragraph for `context: fork`. It MUST do two things:

  (a) Explicitly state that the goal is to keep verbose intermediate output OUT OF
      THE MAIN SESSION / conversation. A deploy check walks the working tree,
      inspects diffs, and runs several enumeration passes — none of that has any
      value to the calling session once we know whether to ship. Only the
      structured summary should return to the main conversation.

  (b) Note that `context: fork` is a Claude Code PRODUCT FEATURE operating at the
      skill-invocation layer, conceptually analogous to the Architect's Playbook
      *Branching Reality* pattern (which describes session-level forking via
      `fork_session`). Mention both so a reader who knows the Playbook can map the
      mental model.
-->

## Checks

Run all three. Each check produces a pass-or-fail verdict; if any fails, the overall summary is **fail**.

<!--
TODO: Write at least THREE pre-deployment checks. For each check, declare:

  - Detect: the exact command(s) or signal(s) that determine whether the
            condition holds.
  - Pass:   what a passing result looks like.
  - Fail:   what a failing result looks like, including what to surface in the
            verdict-summary so the author can act on it.

Suggested checks (you may substitute equivalents if your team's deploy
shape needs different ones):

  1. Uncommitted changes — `git status --porcelain` returns empty.
  2. Migrations up-to-date with code — every new repository import in the diff
     since the target branch is backed by a migration file in the same branch.
  3. CI checks green on the open PR — `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`
     reports all required checks as SUCCESS.
-->

## Output format

Return exactly this shape to the main session:

```
verdict: pass | fail
checks:
  - name: <check-name>
    status: pass | fail
    detail: <one line or empty>
```

Do not include the raw `git status`, raw diff hunks, or full check logs in the returned summary — those stay in the fork. If the author wants to investigate a failed check, they can re-invoke the skill targeting that single check or run the underlying command themselves.

## Personalization

<!--
TODO: Add a short note explaining that this skill is project-scoped
      (`.claude/skills/deploy-check/`) so the whole team gets the same checks.
      Mention that a teammate who wants a stricter personal variant — say, one
      that additionally fails when the diff exceeds 500 lines without a long
      enough PR description — can create a parallel skill at
      `~/.claude/skills/deploy-check-strict/` with a different name. Their
      variant will not be committed to the repo and will not affect teammates.
-->

## What this skill deliberately does not do

- It never pushes, deploys, or runs migrations. The `allowed-tools` allowlist is read-only by construction; even if a future maintainer adds `Write` here, the team's `/review` command should catch the change.
- It does not run the test suite. Tests have their own pre-merge gate in CI; duplicating that here would slow every deploy check without adding signal.
- It does not check for secrets in code. That's the job of the `gitleaks` pre-commit hook, which fails the commit, not the deploy.
